#+title: ~ol-rustdoc~ -- Basic support for Rust docs in Orgmode
#+AUTHOR: Edward Minnix III


Provides the ~rustdoc:~ hyperlink prefix. Syntax is the fully qualified Rust
path, followed by a suffix for what language construct it is (e.g. ~#enum~ to
specify it is an enum).

E.g. ~rustdoc:std::cmp::Ord#trait~ will redirect to the documentation for the
~Ord~ trait in ~std::cmp~.
